                <p>Coding runs the world as we know it, but the vast majority of people aren’t even aware of its existence, let alone what it even is, despite the fact that coding is vital for most of the contemporary businesses.</p>
            <p> Now, in simple terms, let’s define coding as the basic act of writing – in a programming language – a script that a computer can understand. This script will tell the computer to behave in a certain way, to do a certain thing, and to, ultimately, perform the actions that you want it to – if your code is right. Computers don't understand human language and in order for us to see some results (like displaying a web page), we have to write it in a way that the computer would understand.
            </p>
                <p>Coding 101 - Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary. If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding. </p>

            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> <a href="">HTML</a> is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</p>
                    
                    <code><main class="main-class">Main Class.</main></code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <P> <a href="">CSS</a> is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</P>
                    <code>#navbar ul li:hover {color: yellow; background-color: black; } </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <P> <a href="">JavaScript</a> is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</P>
                    <code>const person = {
                        firstName: "John",
                        lastName: "Doe",
                        id: 5566,
                        fullName: function() {
                          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                        }
                      };</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
                    an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>
                <li><p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
                    server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
                    continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application or perform file manipulations
                    on a server....</p></li>
            </ul>

            <article class="main-article">
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");</code>

            <header>Variables</header>
            <article class="main-article">
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
                can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
                sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article class="main-article">
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
                same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
                initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
                omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
